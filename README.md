### Usage

```js
function yourMethod() {
    // Wonderous, magical code
}

Time(yourMethod); // 23 ms
```

Tell `Time` about a function, and it'll tell you about how fast it is.  

### Time is using console.log, and I wanna test on mobile

`Time` understands your plight.

```js
Time(yourMethod, {
    notification : 'alert'
});
```

### This is great, but does this library have a memorable catchphrase? 

Isn't it about time you used `Time`?
